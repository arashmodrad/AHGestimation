# AHGestimation

Using pre-processed observation data from the USGS, we can evaluate
learn some things about estimating power law fits from noisy data.

``` r
length(usgs_obs)
#> [1] 3544
```

Taking a random station we subset data occurring after 2010-01-01 and
that falls within the 2 year reoccurance interval (defined via NWM v20
reanalysis product).

``` r
index = 5
  
tmp = usgs_obs[[index]] %>% 
    filter(as.Date(date) > as.Date('2010-01-01')) %>% 
    filter(inChannel == TRUE) %>%
    filter(Ymean > 0) %>%
    filter(V > 0) %>%
    filter(TW > 0) %>%
    filter(Q > 0) %>%
    filter(is.finite(Ymean)) %>% dplyr::select(date,Q, TW, V, Y = Ymean)

dim(tmp)
#> [1] 63  5
```

## Single Relationship fits

Here we use the ahg estimate package to fit the Q-Y relationship using
OLS and NLS models:

``` r
ahg_estimate(Q = tmp$Q, Y = tmp$Y, allowance = .05)
#> NLS performs best for the Q-Y realtionship
#> $Y
#>         exp       coef nrmse   pb method
#> 1 0.5956429 0.06411443   8.8 -1.4    ols
#> 2 0.5068066 0.11060798   7.7  0.8    nls
```

Overall we see that the the NLS model provides a better fit (albeit
small) when measured both by nRMSE and pBais.

## Full Hydraulic fits

When we have data regarding all three hydraulic states (V,TW,Y) we can
ensure that the solutions found are physically valid (meets the
continuity constraint Q = Y*V*TW).

In this mode the OLS and NLS models are fit, and if continuity is not
met, then a Evolutionary approach is implemented. Doing so produces 3
unique fits for 3 variables (27 total combinations). These are crossed
to identify the best performing relationships that meet continuity at a
prescribed allowance:

``` r
ahg_estimate(Q = tmp$Q, V = tmp$V, TW = tmp$TW, Y = tmp$Y, allowance = .05)
#> NLS performs best for the Q-Y realtionship
#> NLS performs best for the Q-TW realtionship
#> NLS performs best for the Q-V realtionship
#> NLS does not meet continuity ...  ðŸ‘Ž
#> OLS does not meet continuity ...  ðŸ‘Ž
#> The best performing method (nls) is not physically valid ... ðŸ˜¢

In the above example we see that NLS was able to provide better fits the
OLS but neither NLS or OLS was able to provide physically valid
solutions (c1, c2, viable). While the GA approach was able to provide a
physically valid solution, its error was almost 10% higher then the
OLS/NLS methods.

However a combined approach of a NLS, OLS, and GA fit was able to
provide a physically valid result with only .9% more error the seen in
the best performing NLS method.

## Take home points of this paper:

> NLS is better then OLS for predicting single relationships in almost
> every case and should become the defacto approach.

> When fitting an entire system, OLS and NLS often provide results that
> are not physically valid.

> GA approaches can always find a physically valid solution but often
> introduce disproportionate error.

> Instead, using a mishmash of NLS, OLS, and GA fits (in cases of
> non-valid solutions), can find solutions with minimal error AND
> physical validity. We argue this approach is the proper way to fit AHG
> relationships.

> This process in formalized in the AHGestimation R packages.
